# wall-bounce-simulation
A simulation of how a ball bounces when hitting walls of different angles. Outputs the expected trajectory

I decided to take on a challenge and build a pool table simulation. The first and most basic part is getting a ball bouncing off walls. I began implementing that, but then i thought - it would be way more interesting if the walls were NOT in right angles. So I shifted and decided to construct something that would allow me to fiddle around with walls, and calculate a ball's course accordingly.The trickiest part was finding line intersections (ball trajectory and wall), which I ended up googling and finding some algorithm. The next step would be to add more balls that move in the opposite direction of the angle in which they were hit along their circumference... but that's a battle for another day.
